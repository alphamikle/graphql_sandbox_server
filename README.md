This is a demo-example to show how GraphQL works with Nest.js

To init the project type in the console:
```bash
npm i
```

After that, to run the app type in the console:
```bash
npm run start:dev
```

Also, to watch changes in `*.graphql` files you should run generator by this command:
```bash
npm run generate
```

After starting the project will be available at `http://localhost:3000`
